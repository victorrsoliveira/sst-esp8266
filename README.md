# SST on ESP8266

This project was developed as a final assignment for the course of Real-Time Systems - 2016.1 at the Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil.

The SST (Super Simpler Tasker) is an open source project for a minimal scheduler to be used in embedded systems. More information can be found in [here](http://www.embedded.com/design/prototyping-and-development/4025691/Build-a-Super-Simple-Tasker).

Because of the nature of SST is very simple, it was asked in the requirements of this assignment to add some features to SST, such as inscreasing the number of priority levels in SST and consequently the number of tasks, and creating inter task communication mechanisms using semaphores, mailboxes and queues.
